# testingstrategyguidance
A document template for a Testing Strategy document you can bring to your project. Consistency is very important when testing else tests become more bloat to a project and eventually more debt. Testing needs to be a coordinated attack where everyone is on the same team. 

It's better to not write any tests than to make testing something everyone does their own way.

## Does this ever change?

Yes.

## Will this fit my project right now?

Maybe not. But it's a start. Discuss with your team, inspect and adapt.
